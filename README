Version:           2.0.0
Requires at least: 3.0.0
Tested up to:      3.2.1

== Description ==

This class will revolutionize how plugins can be handled for WordPress themes. By using classes that are
utilized within WordPress, the TGM_Plugin_Activation class can automatically install and activate multiple
plugins that are either packaged with a theme or downloaded from the WordPress Plugin Repository.

This class uses the WP_Filesystem Abstraction class to find the best way to install the plugin. WP_Filesystem
searches through a number of methods (Direct, FTP, FTP Sockets, SSH) and determines the best one for use based
on the user's server setup. If FTP is needed, a form will be displayed to prompt users to input their FTP
credentials. To do the installing, this class uses the Plugin_Upgrader and Plugin_Skin_Installer classes to
download, install and activate the plugins. This class also uses WP_Error to display any errors to users
during the plugin installation and activation process.

== Installation ==

1. Drop the class file somewhere in your theme hierarchy.
2. Add a require_once call within functions.php (or other theme file) referencing the class file.
3. Create a function, hooked to `tgmpa_register`, that registers the plugin and configurations.

For steps 2 and 3, it is recommended your view, copy and paste the contents of example.com
and amend to suit. The example.php file is a model for how you should include the class in your theme.

Some important things to note:

1. With the `require_once` call, make sure to amend the path to the correct location within your theme.
2. For plugins pulled from the .org repo, the source argument is optional. Otherwise it is required and should point
   to the absolute path for the plugin zips within your theme, or to a URL for zips elsewhere online.
3. The $config variable holds an array of arguments that can be used to customize aspects of the class.
   If you define an absolute default path for packaged plugins, you do not need to specify the directory path
   for your pre-packaged plugin within the 'source' argument. You will only need to specify the zip file name.

== TODO ==

Here is a short list of desired large improvements:

* Consolidate nag messages into one message split into two categories (plugins not installed and plugins installed but not activated)
* Add a bulk installer button at the top of the install plugins page to allow users to install all included/repo plugins at once

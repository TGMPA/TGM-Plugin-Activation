# Changelog for TGM Plugin Activation library

## 2.4.1 (2015-04-22)

* Improve escaping for URLs and attributes.

## 2.4.0 (2014-03-17)

* All textdomain strings now made to `tgmpa` and remove all notices dealing with textdomain and translation issues.
* The `_get_plugin_basename_from_slug` method now checks for exact slug matches to prevent issues with plugins that start with the same slug.
* Commenting style now adjusted so it is easier to comment large chunks of code if necessary.
* Plugins from an external source now properly say `Private Repository` in the list table output.
* `add_submenu_page` has been changed to `add_theme_page` for better theme check compatibility.
* Removed the use for `parent_menu_slug` and `parent_menu_url` for $config options (see above).
* Nag messages can now be forced on via a new `dismissable` config property. When set to false, nag cannot be dismissed.
* New config `dismiss_msg` used in conjunction with `dismissable`. If `dismissable` is false, then if `dismiss_msg` is not empty, it will be output at the top of the nag message.
* Better contextual message for activating plugins - changed to "Activate installed plugin(s)" to "Begin activating plugin(s)".
* Added cache flushing on theme switch to prevent stale entries from remaining in the list table if coming back to a theme with TGMPA.
* TGMPA is now a singleton to prevent extra settings overrides.
* Fixed bug with duplicating plugins if multiple themes/plugins that used TGMPA were active at the same time.
* Added contextual message updates depending on WordPress version.
* Better nag message handling. If the nag has been dismissed, don't even attempt to build message (performance enhancement).
* Ensure class can only be instantiated once (instantiation moved inside the `class_exists` check for TGMPA).
* Change instances of `admin_url` to `network_admin_url` to add better support for MultiSite (falls back gracefully for non-MultiSite installs).
* Updated much of the code to match WP Coding Standards (braces, yoda conditionals, etc.).
* Myriads of other bug fixes and enhancements

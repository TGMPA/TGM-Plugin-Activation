TGM Plugin Activation
=====================

**Contributors:** Thomas Griffin (@jthomasgriffin / thomasgriffinmedia.com), Gary Jones (Github: @GaryJones / Twitter: GaryJ)  
**Version:** 2.4.2  
**Requires at least:** 3.0.0  
**Tested up to:** 4.2  

## Description ##

TGM Plugin Activation is a PHP library that allows you to easily require or recommend plugins for your WordPress themes (and plugins). It allows your users to install and even automatically activate plugins in singular or bulk fashion using native WordPress classes, functions and interfaces. You can reference pre-packaged plugins, plugins from the WordPress Plugin Repository or even plugins hosted elsewhere on the internet.

## Installation ##

1. Drop the class file somewhere in your theme hierarchy.
2. Add a `require_once` call within `functions.php` (or other theme file) referencing the class file.
3. Create a function, hooked to `tgmpa_register`, that registers the plugin and configurations.

For steps 2 and 3, it is recommended you view, copy and paste the contents of `example.php`
and amend to suit. The `example.php` file is a model for how you should include the class in your theme.

*Some important things to note:*

1. With the `require_once` call, make sure to amend the path to the correct location within your theme.
2. For plugins pulled from the .org repo, the source argument is optional. Otherwise it is required and should point
   to the absolute path for the plugin zips within your theme, or to a URL for zips elsewhere online.
3. The `$config` variable holds an array of arguments that can be used to customize aspects of the class.
   If you define an absolute default path for packaged plugins, you do not need to specify the directory path
   for your pre-packaged plugin within the `'source'` argument. You will only need to specify the zip file name.

## Changelog ##

### 2.4.2 ###

* Fixed: Bundled/pre-packaged plugins would no longer install when using the Bulk installer. This was a regression introduced in v2.4.1. [#321], [#316] Props [Juliette Reinders Folmer]. Thanks [tanshcreative] for reporting.
* Fixed: Bulk installer did not honour a potentially set `default_path` for local prep-packaged plugins. [#203], [#332] Props [Juliette Reinders Folmer]. Thanks [pavot] and [djcowan] for reporting.
* Removed call to `screen_icon()` function which was deprecated in WP 3.8. [#244], [#224], [#234]. Props [Nate Wright]. Thanks [hamdan-mahran] and [Sandeep] for reporting.
* Fixed: _"PHP Fatal error: Class 'TGM_Bulk_Installer' not found"_ [#185] Thanks [Chris Talkington] for reporting.

### 2.4.1 ###

* Improve escaping for URLs and attributes.

### 2.4.0 ###

* All textdomain strings now made to `tgmpa` and remove all notices dealing with textdomain and translation issues.
* The `_get_plugin_basename_from_slug` method now checks for exact slug matches to prevent issues with plugins that start with the same slug.
* Commenting style now adjusted so it is easier to comment large chunks of code if necessary.
* Plugins from an external source now properly say `Private Repository` in the list table output.
* `add_submenu_page` has been changed to `add_theme_page` for better theme check compatibility.
* Removed the use for `parent_menu_slug` and `parent_menu_url` for $config options (see above).
* Nag messages can now be forced on via a new `dismissable` config property. When set to false, nag cannot be dismissed.
* New config `dismiss_msg` used in conjunction with `dismissable`. If `dismissable` is false, then if `dismiss_msg` is not empty, it will be output at the top of the nag message.
* Better contextual message for activating plugins - changed to "Activate installed plugin(s)" to "Begin activating plugin(s)".
* Added cache flushing on theme switch to prevent stale entries from remaining in the list table if coming back to a theme with TGMPA.
* TGMPA is now a singleton to prevent extra settings overrides.
* Fixed bug with duplicating plugins if multiple themes/plugins that used TGMPA were active at the same time.
* Added contextual message updates depending on WordPress version.
* Better nag message handling. If the nag has been dimissed, don't even attempt to build message (performance enhancement).
* Ensure class can only be instantiated once (instantion moved inside the `class_exists` check for TGMPA).
* Change instances of `admin_url` to `network_admin_url` to add better support for MultiSite (falls back gracefully for non-MultiSite installs).
* Updated much of the code to match WP Coding Standards (braces, yoda conditionals, etc.).
* Myriads of other bug fixes and enhancements
